<td>A nice set of short lectures and practical lectures to get your hands on some motion planning problems on real-world hardware in outdoor experiments. For example, in 2022 the task was to run an inspection task on two drones to scan a power line. Beyond that, you get a lot of free, tasty beer ;)</td>
